# What Now?

<p>
        Thank you for reading this LFS book. We hope that you have found this
        book helpful and have learned more about the system creation process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that the LFS system is installed, you may be wondering
        <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">What
        next?</span>&rdquo;</span> To answer that question, we have compiled
        a list of resources for you.

      <div class="itemizedlist">

          <li class="listitem">

            <p>
              Bugs and security notices are reported regularly for all
              software. Since an LFS system is compiled from source, it is up
              to you to keep abreast of such reports. There are several
              online resources that track such reports, some of which are
              shown below:
