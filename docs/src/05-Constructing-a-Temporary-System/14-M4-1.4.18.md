# Installation of M4

First, make some fixes required by glibc-2.28:

```sh
sed -i 's/IO_ftrylockfile/IO_EOF_SEEN/' lib/\*.c
echo "#define \_IO_IN_BACKUP 0x100" >> lib/stdio-impl.h
```

Prepare M4 for compilation:

```sh
./configure --prefix=/tools
```

Compile the package:

```sh
make
```

Compilation is now complete. As discussed earlier, running the test suite is not mandatory for the temporary tools here in this chapter. To run the M4 test suite anyway, issue the following command:

```sh
make check
```

Install the package:

```sh
make install
```

> Details on this package are located in [Section 6.14.2, “Contents of M4”](../06-Installing-Basic-System-Software/14-M4-1.4.18.md).
